Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.

1. What is your name?
  Halee Mason
  
2. Why are you interested in Data Science?
  I love doing data analysis at my current job. I am a Clinical Laboratory Scientist, specializing in Flow Cytometry and my favorite part about the job is acquisition and analysis of the data for each patient.  I discovered Data Science and found how closely it correlates with my current interests. 
  
3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?
  I have dabbled in MOOCs on Coursera and worked my way through CodeAcademy's Python course to begin giving myself familiarity with programming. I do not use any programming within my current job.
  
4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?
  I have taken Statistics in my freshman year of college. In my position as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist, I often enter results and quality control values that must be within a certain SD to be considered in range. There are Levy Jennings plots I review and other mean, median, and mode values I must enter. 
  
5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?
  No, very little.
  
6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?
  How to program in R and Python!
  
7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
  I am learning how to Scuba Dive this semester. :)
